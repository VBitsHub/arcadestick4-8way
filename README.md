This is code for the Arduino Micro Pro to support the gate designed by Tinkering_On_Steriods located at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4244483
Tinkering_On_Steriods design required a Teensy which I do not have and I had an Arduino Micro Pro laying around with some other spare parts. 


Part lists:
STL provided above at the thingiverse site.
Arduino Pro Micro
SG90 Servo
0.96 inch oled Serial Module
TSF-1166 tactial switch
45 Ohms resistor
